Hi, I'm Rinaldy Pasya!

Iâ€™m a Backend Engineer with deep expertise in designing, developing, and maintaining scalable, high-performance backend systems. With 6+ years of experience, I specialize in building resilient architectures, microservices, and RESTful APIs, primarily using Go (Golang), Postgresql, and modern DevOps tools.

Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve architected and deployed systems that serve millions of users reliably, focusing on performance, maintainability, and security. My passion lies in problem-solving at scaleâ€”whether that means optimizing data flow, refactoring legacy systems, or building backend services from the ground up.

Iâ€™m a strong advocate of clean code, domain-driven design (DDD), and test-driven development (TDD). I enjoy mentoring junior engineers and working cross-functionally with product and frontend teams to deliver robust, user-centric applications.

Key Areas of Expertise:

- Go (Golang), Node.js, Python

- PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, MongoDB

- Microservices architecture & system design

- gRPC, REST APIs, WebSockets

- CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP

- Message Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS)

- Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

- Performance optimization & code scalability

- Agile, Scrum, and DevOps culture
